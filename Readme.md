# Standalone Swift Game Engine

This is my no dependency platform independent game engine taking advantage of the new experimental Swift Embedded Mode.

It is intended to be built with `make`, but I am trying to get it working as a Swift package to get sourcekit-lsp support. It works but doesn't build properly.
